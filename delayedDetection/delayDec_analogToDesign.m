% code to create a peri-event design matrix based on an analog trace. Trace
% should be continous and will be reshaped into a trial structure to create
% a design matrix for every trial individually.
% Inputs:   traceIn = analog trace.
%           stdThresh = threshold for event detection in SDUs
%           trialCnt = number of trials in the dataset. used to reshape analog trace.
%           sourceRate = sampling rate of analog trace
%           targRate = sampling rate of design matrix.
%           motorIdx = index for peri-event matrix.
%           gaussShift = variable for subsampling in case model is used with gaussian convolution.
